  * K-armed bandit problem, so named by analogy to a slot machine,

  * Each action selection is like a play of one of the slot machineâ€™s levers,
  * and the rewards are the payoffs for hitting the jackpot.
  * Through repeated action selections you are to maximize your winnings by
  * concentrating your actions on the best levers.
