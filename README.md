Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Study
===

This repository provides basic abstractions and tools to study reinforcement learning algorithms:

- Environment
- Agent
- Policy

and set of testing tools to validate and compare results.

Explored problems
---

- K-armed bandit: non-deterministic, stationary and non-stationery problems solved using epsilon greedy agent 
- Frozen Lake: non-deterministic, stationary board-like problem
